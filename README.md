## How to Start?
1. Go to terminal and run this code `git clone https://github.com/mop9047/flight_search.git`

## Make a new branch
The main branch is where the final approved code will be. For testing, make a branch first to keep you own changes trackable.
1. Go to the terminal assigned to the cloned repository and run `git checkout -b your_branch` where **your branch** is the name of the branch, best to put your name and the feature you are working on (E.g John_Add_Flights).
2. Commit your changes
3. Check with `git branch` to see all branches. The one with the * is the current branch you are working on.

## Pull Request
1. When done with the code, do a pull request to merge your changes with the main branch
